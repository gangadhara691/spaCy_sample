"""A simple example of extracting relations between phrases and entities using
spaCy's named entity recognizer and the dependency parse. Here, we extract
money and currency values (entities labelled as MONEY) and then check the
dependency tree to find the noun phrase they are referring to â€“ for example:
$9.4 million --> Net income.
